idea:
create a script which can read a data file (excel) which has the format of input hours
hours | date | payout status

---
The script must be running in the background continuesly or similar. (perhaps each bootup on a dedicated pc/container/etc.)
or a daemon process or smth.

and then check if the date is the final date of the month (in a week)

It then sums up the amount of hours in the respective month.

Afterwards, a mail is sent to XXX with a template mail stating the amount of hours in the period..
